## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

### Security
- Require a session or a valid share link to read plants, tags, locations and
  statistics when `SHOW_PROTECTED_VIEW=true`. These endpoints were readable anonymously.
- Lock an account for 15 minutes after 10 failed logins, and give unknown usernames the
  same response time as wrong passwords.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-08-21

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

### Security
- Require admin authentication to create users. `POST /api/users/` accepted
  unauthenticated requests and honoured a client-supplied role, so anyone could
  create themselves an admin account and then simply log in.
- Restrict role changes to admins. Any authenticated user could previously promote
  themselves to admin via `PUT /api/users/{id}`.
- Require authentication for every state-changing endpoint across plants, tags and
  locations. These previously accepted anonymous writes and deletes whenever
  `AUTH_MODE` was `local` or `oidc`.
- Enforce share links as read-only. A share token no longer authorises writes.
